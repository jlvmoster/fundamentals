# The Fundamental Concepts of Programming

When a software developer understands one coding language, it becomes easy to pick up future languages since the fundamental concepts are similar. This document contains those concepts and how we can be more aware of them so that we can articulate our technical knowledge.

## Variable Declaration

All languages come with a feature for storing values, or `literals`, called variables.

## Data Types and Structures

Every language regardless of strongly-typed or loosely-typed, has a data type associated with a value or variable as well as a data structure for handling more complex data.

## Flow Control Structures

By its very nature, programming languages exist to execute code in a automatic and logical fashion. Conditionals (if-else, switch-case, boolean) and Loops (for, while, do-while) enable a control flow for all languages now and in the future.

## Functions and Objects

Functions and Objects lean more towards a programming paradigm since some languages are tailored for one over the other, but the concept is the same throughout; modularity and abstraction.

## Debugging and Tools

With every language come errors (bugs) and tools to assist in the development of programs and troubleshooting of errors.

## Advanced Concepts

The five concepts above are the introductory concepts all developers should know before they move on to advanced concepts such as:
- Input/Output Streams
- Concurrency and Parallelism
- Recursion
- Sockets & Networking
- Security
- Graphical User Interfaces
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Design Patterns
- Testing
- And many more!!!
